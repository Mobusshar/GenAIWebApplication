    <h3 class="text-success"> Task: Exploring Human Emotions Through Storytelling </h3>
    <p style="color: #333; font-weight: 500;">
      Welcome to this reflective and immersive exercise! Today, we’ll be diving deep into the complex world of human emotions—a rich and intricate landscape that shapes everything from our decisions to our dreams.
    </p>
    <h4 class="text-primary"> Did you know?</h4>
    <p style="color: #333; font-weight: 500;">
      Humans are capable of experiencing thousands of emotions, often blending together in subtle and unpredictable ways. Some are fleeting like a passing cloud, while others leave lasting imprints on our minds. From joy to jealousy, pride to panic—every emotion tells a story.
    </p>
    <h4 class="text-info"> In this activity:</h4>
    <p style="color: #333; font-weight: 500;">
      We’ll narrow our focus to 15 distinct emotions, each playing a unique role in shaping a narrative. Your task is to explore how these emotions unfold in the life of a character you create.
    </p>
    <h4 class="text-warning">🔧 What to Do:</h4>
    <ul style="text-align: left; color: #333; font-weight: 500;">
      <li><strong>Create a character:</strong> Begin by choosing a male character name—this will be the main figure navigating the emotional journey.</li>
      <li><strong>Read the story passage carefully:</strong> Take your time and read the full narrative. This story is designed to show emotional transitions—pay close attention to how feelings shift throughout the events.</li>
      <li><strong>Work with your teammate:</strong> Discuss how the character might be feeling in different parts of the story. Try to empathize with the character—put yourself in their shoes.</li>
      <li><strong>Learn about the emotions:</strong> Click the “View Emotion Descriptions” button to read short explanations and examples of the 15 emotions. This will help guide your interpretations.</li>
      <li><strong>Complete the story’s emotional arc:</strong> You'll find 15 empty fields, each representing a moment where the character experiences one of the identified emotions. For each field, write 1–2 sentences explaining how that emotion is expressed or felt in that part of the story. Don’t leave any field blank—each emotion plays an important role!</li>
      <li><strong>Add a meaningful ending:</strong> After completing the emotional journey, give your story a final touch: Write a moral or title in a single sentence that reflects the message or essence of the story.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="text-danger">Ready to move on?</h4>
    <p style="color: #333; font-weight: 500;">
      When everything is filled out, click “Update” to proceed to the next stage of the exercise.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #333; font-weight: 500;">
      💡 <strong>Remember:</strong> This task isn’t just about filling blanks—it’s about understanding human emotion on a deeper level. The more you connect with the character, the more powerful your story will be.

            {{story_character}} was indeed a very hardworking man who put in all his efforts in all possible ways. Every morning he woke up early and got prepared for work meticulously to support his family most effectively. But unfortunately, things started going totally non-synchronized, one fine day.
            This particular morning, the alarm failed to ring, and therefore {{story_character}} woke up late. In haste he got up and started living his daily life. He wore a shirt on which some coffee spilled and he got out just missing the usual bus. The rest of it was forced to be walked under a chilly and drizzling rain to get to work. {{story_character}} noted how the rain fell and continued to match his steadily growing exasperation and sense of unluckiness.

            Thanks to the plethora of obstacles piling up in his life, he had exceeded that last point and went further. He had finally made it to work, only to continue discovering frustration. His computer failed him on an important assignment, and everyone else seemed too busy burning their bridges to offer assistance. Every tiny mishap continued accumulating, leaving him tired and mufing up the morale. {{story_character}} heaved a frustrated sigh, staring at his screen, feeling utterly defeated by everything around him.

            Things couldn't get any worse, just as he thought. His boss calls him into the office. "{{story_character}}, your work has been sloppy lately," said the boss coldly. He added, "If this continues, we may need to reconsider your position here." A sudden wave of fear gripped him.
          </p>

            He had worked tireless days; now, one bad day could cost him everything. His hands trembled leaving the office; his heart was pounding.
          </p>
          <p>
            At lunch hour, {{story_character}} sat there alone, gripping a sandwich with white knuckle fingers. One coworker bumped into him; his food hit the floor. "Hey, watch it {{story_character}}," the man dismissively muttered. That was the last straw. Anger erupted in {{story_character}}'s chest.

            "Are you kidding me?!," he snapped, standing abruptly. But when he saw both men's shocked look, he bit his tongue and stormed out to seethe.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a rough day at work, in busy streets {{story_character}} walked home. There were thousands of things racing through his mind frustration, worry, exhaustion, and everything too. It was then that he saw an elderly lady standing at a very crowded sidewalk. Cars rushed past, and she looked like she didn't have the courage to cross such a busy road. Although he was so much into his own trouble, somehow there was that tug he could feel within him to help.

            He did stop for a moment. "I am already having my worst day. Why even bother?" But this egoistic thought was remove from his mind. Something very deep was urging him forward. He went to her and said, "May I help you cross over the street?"
            The eyes of the woman brightened up instantaneously with an illumination associated with relief.
          </p>  
            <textarea id="gratitude" name="gratitude" required #gratitudeField="ngModel" class="form-control" [(ngModel)]="gratitude" placeholder="Gratitude 🙏" title="Feeling thankful for something or someone. Example: Appreciating a friend who helped you when you needed support."></textarea>

            "Oh, it would be a wonderful favor." He carefully took her across this street, protecting her from the flow of impatient rushing cars.

            <textarea id="protectiveness" name="protectiveness" required #protectivenessField="ngModel" class="form-control" [(ngModel)]="protectiveness" placeholder="Protectiveness 🛡️" title="The strong urge to keep someone safe.

            When they reached just at the other side of the street, the woman squeezed his hand, saying, "You have a very kind heart, young man."
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, for the first time in a long time, something inside {{story_character}} changed. He found peace in this simple act of kindness to a stranger that would have been missing from his life for a while now.
          </p>
            <textarea id="serenity" name="serenity" required #serenityField="ngModel" class="form-control" [(ngModel)]="serenity" placeholder="Serenity 🌿" title="A peaceful and calm feeling. Example: Sitting by a quiet lake, listening to the gentle sound of the water."></textarea>

          <p>
            Later that night, {{story_character}} reached home only to find an unexpected surprise lying on his doorstep: a tiny little package along with a handwritten note. The note written by the elderly lady acknowledged her heartfelt gratitude. Within that package was a pair of gloves with a simple message inscribed, "Kindness is a reward."
            {{story_character}}'s eyes went wide as he read the note, and warmth began swell in his chest.
          </p>
            <textarea id="joy" name="joy" required #joyField="ngModel" class="form-control" [(ngModel)]="joy" placeholder="Joy 😄" title="A feeling of great happiness. Example: A child opening a gift and finding their dream toy inside."></textarea>

            And for the first time that day, that was a smile of {{story_character}}'s that could be described as genuine.
          </p>
          <p>
            It has changed the entire scenario; most importantly, it brings some happiness and brightness. Even on a day that feels like it was filled with constant misfortunes, it feels great to have one's kindness appreciated and recognized. In the end, it just goes to show-and point out, really-that even on the worst days, such an act, no matter the proportion, can change everything.

          </p>
          <p>
            The next morning came into play with the strangest of happenings. As he entered his work, he saw the coworker whom he had snapped at yesterday. It would have been easy to ignore him, but instead {{story_character}} took a breath and said, "Hey... I'm sorry about yesterday." The man blinked at him in surprise, then laughed and said, "No worries, {{story_character}}. I was in a bad mood, too." Then they shook hands, and for the first time ever, {{story_character}} felt a sense of kinship with another human being in the workplace.

          </p>
          <p>
            He sat in silent deliberation, understanding what this harsh day really meant for him. He had thought that suffering hardship meant only pain but has now discovered the hidden meaning within.
